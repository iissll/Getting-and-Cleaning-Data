Getting-and-Cleaning-Data : Course Project
=========================

The repository contains the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data"

The "run_analysis.R" file contains the R code that can be used to achieve the following: 1) Transform the UCIHAR Dataset into a matrix of (observations) x (variables), where each observation is one of the 10299 data points captured in the appropriate study[1], and each of the rows is one of the variables measured. For details see description of the appropriate file xMatrixRecuced.csv in the codebook.md file. 2) Produce a new dataset, newData.csv, which contains only the average value of each of the variables for each subject. For details see the description of the appropriate file newData.csv in the codebook.md file.

Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.

The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
