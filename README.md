Getting-and-Cleaning-Data : Course Project
=========================

The repository contains the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data"

The "run_analysis.R" file contains the R code that can be used to achieve the following: 1) Transform the UCIHAR Dataset into a matrix of (observations) x (variables), where each observation is one of the 10299 data points captured in the appropriate study[1], and each of the rows is one of the variables measured. 

Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity. This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.

The CodeBook.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
